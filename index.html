                <h2>Understanding Your True Hourly Wage</h2>
                <p>Your stated hourly wage doesn't tell the whole story. When you factor in unpaid time—commuting, lunch breaks, getting ready for work—your actual hourly rate is often significantly lower than what your employer advertises.</p>

                <p>According to national transportation statistics, the average American commute is 54 minutes round trip. Combined with unpaid lunch breaks and work preparation time, workers can spend 10-15+ hours per week on work-related activities without compensation.</p>

                <p><strong>This calculator reveals your real hourly wage</strong> by accounting for all time you dedicate to your job, not just the hours you're paid for. The results may surprise you.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a true hourly wage?</h3>
                    <p>Your true hourly wage (also called real hourly wage or actual hourly rate) is the amount you actually earn per hour when you account for all time spent on work-related activities, not just your paid working hours. This includes unpaid commute time, lunch breaks, getting ready for work, and any other time dedicated to your job.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why doesn't my employer count commute time as work?</h3>
                    <p>Under federal labor law, employers are generally not required to pay for commute time from home to work. However, this unpaid time still represents hours of your day dedicated to your job. By calculating your true hourly wage, you can see how much this unpaid time actually reduces your effective earnings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How accurate is this calculator?</h3>
                    <p>This calculator provides an estimate based on the information you provide. It accounts for unpaid commute time, lunch breaks, and work preparation time to show your effective hourly rate. The calculation divides your total weekly pay by the total hours you spend on work-related activities each week.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I include in "getting ready for work" time?</h3>
                    <p>Include time spent showering, getting dressed in work-appropriate clothing, preparing and packing lunch, dropping off children at daycare, and any other morning preparation specifically required for your job. The average worker spends 30-45 minutes daily on work-related preparation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does the average American lose to unpaid time?</h3>
                    <p>With an average commute of 54 minutes daily and typical unpaid lunch breaks, most American workers spend 10-15 additional hours per week on work-related activities. For someone earning $25/hour working 40 hours per week, this can represent over $10,000 in lost annual earnings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I use this information in salary negotiations?</h3>
                    <p>Understanding your true hourly wage can inform your salary negotiations, especially when comparing job offers. A higher-paying job with a long commute might actually result in a lower real hourly rate than a closer job with slightly less pay. Consider total time commitment when evaluating opportunities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between hourly rate and annual salary calculations?</h3>
                    <p>This calculator handles both hourly and salaried workers. For salaried employees, we divide your annual salary by your total working hours per year to get your stated hourly rate, then calculate your actual rate including unpaid time. The methodology is the same—we're showing what you really earn per hour of your time.</p>
