# Data-Driven Ideas for a Viral Single-Page Website

*(All data and examples pulled from public sources like Ahrefs/Backlinko, Exploding Topics, Google Trends, and tool landing pages where possible.)*

---

## PART 1 – TRENDING WEB TOOL / CONTENT ANALYSIS

### 1. What people are searching for *right now*

#### 1.1 High-volume evergreen “utility” searches

From Ahrefs’ **Top Google Searches (Nov 2025)** list for the US:

| Keyword         | US monthly searches (approx.) |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| youtube        | 83.6M                         |
| amazon         | 77.2M                         |
| gmail          | 55.0M                         |
| chatgpt        | 49.4M                         |
| facebook       | 47.7M                         |
| wordle         | 43.2M                         |
| calculator     | 24.0M                         |
| google translate | 33.7M                       |
| translate      | 33.1M                         |

Key patterns:

- **“Calculator”-style queries** still have massive volume (calculator, mortgage calculator, BMI, etc.), but these are extremely competitive (big finance/health sites).
- **ChatGPT / AI-related queries** are now in the top tier of searches worldwide.
- People heavily use **search as a tool launcher** (calculator, translate, weather, timer, etc.).

Implication for you:  
Instead of generic calculators, focus on **niche, trend-linked calculators / planners** where big players haven’t saturated the SERPs yet.

---

#### 1.2 Trending topics with tool potential

Exploding Topics’ **Top Trending Topics (Dec 2025)** shows fast-growing searches over the last 5 years, many with clear “tool” opportunities:

Relevant entries:

- **AI Video Generator** – 5-year search growth ~8,500%.
- **AI Agents** – strong, sustained growth.
- **AI for Teachers** – growing niche around lesson planning, classroom tools.
- **Text to Audio AI** – rising interest in TTS, audiobooks, accessibility.
- **Carbon-Plated Running Shoes** – exploding in performance running space.
- **Permanent Outdoor Lights** – big in home/holiday decor.

These are long-term trends, not one-week fads, according to the dataset.

---

#### 1.3 AI tools attracting massive traffic

Exploding Topics’ **“65 Most Popular AI Tools Ranked (Oct 2025)”** (traffic from Semrush) shows:  

- **ChatGPT** – ~321.6M monthly visits (28% share of AI tool traffic).
- **Canva, DeepL, QuillBot, Gemini** – each tens to hundreds of millions of visits.
- Many “helper” tools around writing, translation, summarisation, etc.

Takeaways:

- There’s strong, proven appetite for **tiny helpers that sit *around* big AI tools** (formatters, idea generators, calculators, prompt builders), not just full-blown AI apps.

---

### 2. Viral web tools from the last ~6–12 months

We don’t have a neat “top 10 viral micro-sites” list, but we can infer from:

- Media coverage
- SEO tool lists (e.g. “best YouTube idea generators”)
- Trend reports and app stories

#### 2.1 LingGuang “vibe coding” app (Ant Group)

- Chinese AI app for “vibe coding” – users describe what they want, it generates small programs.
- Hit **1M downloads in 4 days** and **2M in 6 days**; its core “flash program” tool actually crashed due to traffic.
- Users created things like **kid activity generators** and **car cost savings calculators** directly from prompts.

**What made it viral?**

- Extremely simple, **single-prompt → working app**.
- Feels magical (“I just type an idea and I get a tool”), so everyone posts screenshots.
- Built-in virality: people share the tiny apps they created.

---

#### 2.2 Video idea generators for creators

Several AI video idea generators have popped up and are getting significant traction:

- **vidIQ AI Video Ideas Generator** – helps YouTubers brainstorm ideas based on trends in their niche.  
- **VEED AI Video Idea Generator** – generates video ideas (topic, vibe, format) for social platforms.  
- **Independent tools (ryrob, Lenostube, Unbounce TikTok Idea Generator)** – very simple landing pages offering “enter topic → get ideas”.  

These aren’t necessarily “Wordle-level” viral, but they tick the boxes:

- Very **simple** utility.
- Deeply tied to a **high-growth market** (short-form video).
- Great **social proof / shareability** (“this tool gave me 50 video ideas in 10 seconds”).

---

#### 2.3 Patterns in “viral-ish” tools

Common features:

1. **Single, very narrow promise**  
   - “Generate video ideas”  
   - “Turn your text into a TikTok script”  
   - “Create a flash app from a prompt”

2. **Fast gratification**  
   - One form → instant results; no signup.

3. **Built-in “look what I made” moment**  
   - Output is screenshot-able, quote-tweet-able, or something you can show in 15 seconds on TikTok.

4. **Piggybacking on bigger platforms**  
   - YouTube, TikTok, Reels, etc.

---

### 3. Underserved niches (gaps + opportunities)

Using:

- Exploding Topics trending list,  
- Searches for specific calculators,  
- And what *doesn’t* show up as a polished tool,

we get some potentially underserved niches.

#### 3.1 AI for teachers – micro-tools

Current landscape:

- Lots of **full lesson planners** and **generic online timers**, e.g. Classroomscreen, Planbook, ClassDojo.  
- Very few **tiny, single-page helpers** like:
  - “Break this 45-minute lesson into segments automatically.”
  - “Convert curriculum outcomes into exit-ticket questions.”
  - “Build a bell-ringer list for the week.”

**Gap:**  
Teachers search and share tools *constantly*, but most products are heavy SaaS. A single, free, no-login **segment-timer** or **quick-planner** could fill a real need.

---

#### 3.2 AI agents & workflows

“AI Agents” are exploding as a concept, but:

- Most resources are **blog posts** or **framework docs**, not simple, visual helpers.  
- There is no ubiquitous “agent task builder” that:
  - Lets you map out goal → steps → inputs → guardrails.
  - Exports a clean prompt you can paste into any agent tool (ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, LangChain, etc).

**Gap:**  
A **front-end-only prompt/flow composer** for agents is a practical, unmet need in a growing space.

---

#### 3.3 Carbon-plated shoes & performance calculators

- “Carbon-plated running shoes” are trending as a category.  
- There are many **articles** on how much time they save; some brand-specific calculators exist for environmental impact, but there isn’t a widely known consumer-facing **“how much faster?” calculator**.

**Gap:**  
A fun, shareable **“How many seconds can I shave off my 5k?”** calculator for super-shoes.

---

#### 3.4 Permanent outdoor lights & cost planners

Search results show:  

- Manufacturer / retailer tools for **carbon footprint** or **power usage**, often buried.
- Little in the way of a general, neutral **“permanent outdoor lights planner”** that:
  - Calculates strip length
  - Estimates power draw & monthly cost
  - Shows a simple layout.

**Gap:**  
A single, neutral planning calculator could do well for long-tail SEO and be very shareable in home-improvement communities.

---

#### 3.5 Text-to-audio AI & script helpers

With **text-to-audio AI** trending, there are many TTS engines, but few tools that:

- Format a **long script into scenes** for voiceover.
- Automatically insert **pauses, emphasis markers, and SSML tags**.
- Make it ready to drop into any TTS engine.

**Gap:**  
A lightweight **“Text → TTS-ready script formatter”** supporting a few popular SSML patterns.

---

---

## PART 3 – DOMAIN NAME RESEARCH (TOP 5 CONCEPTS)

### Important limitation

Right now I **can’t directly query new domain WHOIS pages or registrar APIs** from this environment – I’m restricted to URLs that already appeared in earlier browsing results.

However, in an earlier tool session (different interface) I *did* check a few candidate domains via **who.is**; those showed **“No WHOIS data was found”**, which usually means “not registered (or not in that registry)”. I’ll use those where possible and clearly label them.

For all other suggestions, I’ll give **well-formed, likely available names** and typical prices, but you should double-check availability on Namecheap / Cloudflare / Porkbun before buying.

Typical annual costs:

- `.com`: **~$10–$15/yr**
- `.io`: **~$30–$40/yr**
- `.ai`: **~$60–$80/yr**
- `.app`: **~$15–$25/yr**

(Prices vary slightly by registrar and promos.)

---

### Concept 1 – HookSpark (AI Video Ideas)

Previously checked domain:

- **videoideagenerator.com** – who.is reported **“No WHOIS data was found”**, i.e., likely unregistered at the time of check.  

**Suggested domains (3):**

1. **videoideagenerator.com**  
   - Status: likely available (see above).  
   - Type: SEO-heavy, exact match.  
   - Expected cost: ≈ **$10–15/yr (.com)**.

2. **hookideas.com**  
   - Status: *not checked* in this environment.  
   - Short, brandable; good for broader “hook” tools.  
   - Expected cost: ≈ **$10–15/yr** if available.

3. **hookspark.app**  
   - Status: *not checked*; `.app` works well for a single tool.  
   - Brandable, aligns with product name.  
   - Expected cost: ≈ **$15–25/yr (.app)**.

---

### Concept 2 – ClassFlow (Lesson Segment Timer)

Previously checked domain (different yet very aligned tool idea):

- **teachtimer.app** – who.is showed **no WHOIS data**, suggesting it was unregistered at time of check.  

**Suggested domains:**

1. **teachtimer.app**  
   - Status: likely available (per earlier who.is check).  
   - Simple, highly descriptive for your tool.  
   - Expected cost: ≈ **$15–25/yr**.

2. **classsegmenttimer.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Very SEO-descriptive (“class segment timer”).  
   - Expected cost: ≈ **$10–15/yr**.

3. **lessontimeline.app**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - More brandable; emphasises the “timeline” feature.  
   - Expected cost: ≈ **$15–25/yr**.

---

### Concept 3 – AgentPrompt (AI Agent Flow Builder)

I wasn’t able to safely check new WHOIS domains for this one here, so treat these as **candidate suggestions**:

1. **agentpromptflow.com**  
   - Status: *not checked (needs registrar lookup)*.  
   - Includes “agent”, “prompt”, “flow”; great keyword coverage.

2. **agentworkflow.app**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Strong for dev/AI audience; `.app` feels modern.

3. **agenttaskbuilder.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Very explicit about what it does.

Expected cost for each:  
- `.com`: ≈ **$10–15/yr**  
- `.app`: ≈ **$15–25/yr**

---

### Concept 4 – GlowPlan (Permanent Outdoor Lights)

Earlier I checked:

- **carbonshoecalc.com** – which we initially considered for the running shoe calculator, but it could also be reused/repurposed branding-wise. who.is reported **no WHOIS data** (likely available at the time).  

For GlowPlan specifically, here are good domain ideas (untested here):

1. **glowplanlights.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Contains “glow”, “plan”, “lights” → decent SEO.

2. **outdoorlightsplanner.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Highly descriptive; likely lower brandability, higher SEO.

3. **permalightplanner.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Nods directly to “permanent lights”.

All three should be in the **$10–15/yr** range if available as `.com`.

---

### Concept 5 – RaceGain (Super-Shoe Calculator)

Again, I can’t live-check right now, but here are sensible domain options:

1. **racegaincalc.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Tight, brandable, includes “calc”.

2. **supershoecalc.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Slightly more fun; direct tie to “super shoes”.

3. **carbonspeedcalc.com**  
   - Status: *not checked*.  
   - Strong SEO hook for “carbon shoes / speed”.

Expected cost: **$10–15/yr** if available.

---

## PART 4 – COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS (TOP 3 CONCEPTS)

### 4.1 HookSpark – AI Video Hook & Idea Generator

**Main competitors**

1. **vidIQ AI Video Ideas Generator** – part of vidIQ’s creator SaaS suite.  
2. **VEED AI Video Idea Generator** – built into VEED’s video tooling platform.  
3. **Independent generators (ryrob, Lenostube, Taja, Unbounce TikTok Idea Generator)**.  

**Traffic estimates (ballpark, from public statements & popularity):**

- VEED and vidIQ each receive **millions of visits/month** overall, though their idea generators are just a small part of that. (VEED is widely referenced as a key video editing SaaS; vidIQ is a top YouTube growth tool.)  

**What they do well**

- Deep integration into their own SaaS platforms.
- Use YouTube channel stats and SEO data for smarter suggestions.
- Good onboarding and cross-sell journeys.

**Where they’re weak (your opportunity)**

- Most require **signup / account** and live inside heavy products.
- No ultra-light, single-page, **“no login, just hooks”** experience.
- Many focus on **video ideas**, not specifically **hook lines**, thumbnails, or short-form intros.

**Monetisation options for you**

- Start free → later:
  - Display ads (mediavine/AdSense type).
  - Sell a simple **hook idea pack** or eBook.
  - Affiliate links to bigger tools (vidIQ, VEED, TubeBuddy).

---

### 4.2 ClassFlow – Lesson Segment Timer

**Competitors**

1. **Classroomscreen Timer widget** – one of many widgets in a classroom dashboard.  
2. **ClassDojo / Planbook / PlanbookEdu** – broader classroom management + lesson planning.  
3. Generic timer tools and Chrome extensions.

**Traffic estimates**

- Tools like Planbook and ClassDojo have **large, established user bases** (hundreds of thousands to millions of users).  

**What they do well**

- Feature-rich platforms; deep integration with classes, rosters, curriculum.
- Trusted brands in education.

**Weak points / gap**

- Overkill for a teacher who just wants **“warm-up 10 min → main activity 20 min → exit ticket 5 min”** in one click.
- Often require **accounts, school adoption, or complex UI**.
- Little emphasis on **visual lesson timeline + auto-advance**.

**Your edge**

- Ultra-simple, **single page** tool.
- No login, mobile-friendly.
- Can be used as a drop-in resource from lesson blogs (“click here to run this 45-minute lesson timeline”).

**Monetisation**

- Education ads are decent CPM.
- Option to upsell a **PDF lesson planner template pack**.
- Could later evolve into a mini-SaaS, but doesn’t need to start that way.

---

### 4.3 AgentPrompt – AI Agent Task Flow Builder

**Competitors**

- There are **many AI agent platforms** (OpenAI agents, LangChain, AutoGen, Flowise, etc.), but most provide:
  - Docs
  - SDKs
  - Complex dashboards
- The closest analogues are:
  - Visual workflow builders inside automation products (n8n, Zapier, Make).  
  - Blog posts offering “templates” for agent prompts.

**Traffic context**

- According to Exploding Topics and related articles:
  - AI productivity tools and AI agents are **fast-growing categories**, with tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini leading the way.  

**What big players do well**

- Deep integrations, team collaboration, robust infrastructure.
- Automation + code execution + multi-step workflows.

**Where they’re weak (your opportunity)**

- Most devs starting out just want **help thinking clearly**:
  - What’s the goal?  
  - What sub-tasks should the agent perform?  
  - What tools is it allowed to use?  
  - How do I articulate success criteria?
- There’s no canonical, **front-end-only “agent brief builder”** to generate a clean prompt or JSON spec.

**Your edge**

- Tools like ChatGPT itself don’t provide a **visual structuring aid**; they *are* the agent.
- A simple agent brief builder:
  - Reduces cognitive load for new users.
  - Can export to copy-paste for any platform.

**Monetisation**

- Highly valuable audience (devs, AI builders).
- Potential:
  - Sponsorship from AI infra companies.
  - Newsletter lead-gen.
  - Premium templates/workflow packs.

### 5.2 When to launch

General best practices (based on social usage patterns):

- **Reddit / Hacker News:**  
  - Weekdays, **US mornings** (Mon–Thu, roughly 8–11am Eastern) – more eyeballs.
- **Twitter/X (global tech/creator audience):**  
  - Weekdays, **late morning / early afternoon UTC** to hit EU + US.
- **TikTok / Reels / consumer stuff:**  
  - Evenings and weekends local time (when people are scrolling).

Given you’re in the UK, a good pattern:

- Soft-launch to a couple of subreddits + X on **Monday early afternoon UK time**.
- Follow up with TikTok/shorts demos in UK evening (6–9pm) and then cross-post over the week.
